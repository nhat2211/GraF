Graph Theory is a powerful tool for studying complex combinatorial structures \cite{cite-key1}. But our project only focus to make the interfaces of the graph and use the interfaces that we improved in the existing library and apply them in the JavaFx \cite{cite-key4} graphic program.
We also have to use TikZ language to draw graphic elements in Latex \cite{cite-key2} for the report. Tikz is probably the most complex and powerful tool to create graphic elements in LATEX. In this article some of the basics will be explained: lines, dots, curves, circles, rectangles, etc by means of simple examples.
Almost the knowledge that we use in this project is from the book DaMN \cite{cite-key3}.

%Existing Analysis
\section{Existing analysis of The graph}
The source codes that we have 3 packages and main source code.
\subsection{The main source code}
In the main source code, we have these classes: Multigraph, GraphWithEmbedding, DirectedEdge, VertexOrEdgeIterator, VertexOrEdgeIterable...
In the MultiGraph, we have the SubMultiGraph, Edges, Vertices, Graph, SubGraph, ParticialMultiGraph, InducedSubMultiGraph. These classed that we use to make and manage the set of graphs.
The classes VertexOrEdgeIterator, VertexOrEdgeIterable are used for loop vertices and edges.
\subsection{Package Collection}
The package Collection is an Iterator Design pattern that we can loop, append and print...
\subsection{Package Graph}
In this package that we have so many classes.
The class Edges that we can add, remove, clear and iterator.
The class Vertices that we also can add, remove, clear and iterator.
The class Graph that we can add Vertex, remove Vertex, add Edge, remove Edge, check the Vertices are neighbour or not, check the Graph contains Vertex V, check the graph contains Edge E, count the degree of the graph and we also can remove all vertices and all edges.
The class MultiGraph and SubMultiGraph have the same functions with the class Graph but they have more sets of the graph.
There are three interfaces here: PartialGraph, InducedSubGraph, SubGraph.
There are these classes VertexOrEdgeIterator, VertexOrEdgeIterable. This is an Iterator design pattern that use for Vertex and Edge.
\subsection{Package Util}
This package have many classes like: Graphs, Vizing, Conjecture, ShortestPathsMatrices, NegativeEdgeException, Lamda, Position, DepthFirstSearchDataImpl, RandomGraphVietnam, RandomGraph, FlowResults, NegativeCircuitException, K Coloring.
Here applies some algorithms like Coloring, Shortest Paths, Depth First Search, Flow Network...
In the flow network that we show the Maximum Flow and minimum cut of the network.
Especially in the class Graphs have so many algorithm functions inside like: breathFirstSearch, dijkstra algorithm, bellmanFord algorithm, floydWarshall, kruskal, prim, fordFulkerson...

 \subparagraph{}  - User can input the number of vertices and the edges and after that user click button create graph, the application will create a graph which user inputed.
 \subparagraph{}  This two basic options for user interface creating the graphs.

\paragraph{}- Design a user interface for solve the shortest path,flow problem.

 \subparagraph{}example: 
 \subparagraph{} - User input the start vertice and the end vertice and after that clicking shortest path button that the application will calculate and print the shortest path in graph interface by highlight the edges with red color.

%Architecture
\section{Architecture}
\subsection{Introduction}
This document provides a high level overview and explains the architecture of Graph Application.
The document defines goals of the architecture, the use cases supported by the system, architectural styles and components that have been selected. The document provides a rationale for the architecture and design decisions made from the conceptual idea to its implementation. 
\subsubsection{Purpose}
The Software Architecture Document (SAD) provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the Graph Application It presents a number of different architectural views to depict the different aspects of the system.  
\subsubsection{Scope}
The scope of this SAD is to explain the architecture of the Graph Application.
This document describes the various aspects of the Graph application design that are considered to be architecturally significant. These elements and behaviors are fundamental for guiding the construction of the Graph application and for understanding this project as a whole.

\subsection{Architectural Representation}
\subsubsection{Use Case view}
Audience: all the stakeholders of the system, including the end-users.
\paragraph{}
Area: describes the set of scenarios and/or use cases that represent some significant, central functionality of the system. Describes the actors and use cases for the system, this view presents the needs of the user and is elaborated further at the design level to describe discrete flows and constraints in more detail. This domain vocabulary is independent of any processing model or representational syntax (i.e. XML).
\subsubsection{Logical view}
Audience: Designers.
\paragraph{}
Area: Functional Requirements: describes the design's object model. Also describes the most important use-case realizations and business requirements of the system.
\paragraph{}
Related Artifacts: Design model

\subsection{Architectural Goals and Constraints}
There are some key requirements and system constraints that have a significant bearing on the architecture.  They are:
\paragraph{}
1.	The system is meant as a proof of concept for a more complete project prediction system to be built in the future.  Therefore one of the primary stakeholders in this document and the system as a whole are future architects and designers, not necessarily users as is normally the case.  As a result, one goal of this document is to be useful to future architects and designers.
\paragraph{}
2.	The system will be written using JAVA 8 technologies but will use an open source JavaFX for Design Graphic user interface and will be runable to operating system with Java Virtual Machine be installed.
\paragraph{}
3.	The Application may be reference to the third-party for graph such as JGraphT.

\subsection{Requirement} 
The GL project of MINF18 here is a set of requests for the project :

1- create a gitHub project with name GraF (for Graph Framework). My login in gitHub is baudon (for the invitation) and the associated adress olivier.baudon@labri.fr Please tell me each time you want that I take a look on your code.

2- Provide an interface which allow to create graphs where a vertex is represented by a circle and an edge by a straight line.

3- Give the possibility to move vertices.

4- Give the possibility to change the form of the vertices and the edges (arc, or segments with intermediate points movable by the user), and to have oriented edges.

5- Give the possibility to suppress a vertex or an edge.

6- Add labels to vertices and edges.

7- Give the possibility to the user to change the position of the labels, and the value of the labels.

Remark : I propose that you provide a toolbar on the left side of the window to propose the different types of vertices and edges and to change the effect of a click (for example, an icon with scissors (or death's head) means supress, an icon with a cross means add an intermediate point to an edge, ...)

For each version, you may also provide the tkz version of the drawing, using a menu for the export.
\subsection{Architecture} 
We use Model-View-Controller in the application development.

\subsection{Framework} 
Why choose JavaFX for Developing Application?:

Our experience proves that implementing an employee desktop front end with native technology is a valid approach and that JavaFX is a good fit.
\begin{itemize}
	\item JavaFX is available on the leading desktop operating systems (Windows, Linux, and . Mac OS X).
	\item Although it has gone through some painful changes, its evolution proves its       vendor's level of commitment.
	\item As the successor to Swing, it is being used by an increasing number of Java developers. Regardless of its future, it will benefit from a strong developer community.
	\item Compared to Swing, it provides a clear and clean architecture and features many enhancements: styling, event management, transitions, scene graph—to name a few.
	\item It provides the possibility of developing up-to-date user interfaces with animations, multitouch, and the like.
	\item It is based on a clear and clean language: Java.
	\item It provides all the professional Java tooling required to debug, analyze, profile, and log a client application.
	\item It enables a simple app-like installation on the client side, without any prerequisites.
	\item In short, we believe that JavaFX is the only native UI environment that provides all these features today.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
Why choose Eclipse IDE for development:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Eclipse is used widely in developer community in the world.
	\item Eclipse support many plugins for development.
	\item Eclipse is free to download and install.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Unit Test} 
Why choose Junit framework for unit test.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item JUnit is an open source framework, which is used for writing and running tests.
	\item Provides annotations to identify test methods.
	\item Provides assertions for testing expected results.
	\item Provides test runners for running tests.
	\item JUnit tests allow you to write codes faster, which increases quality.
	\item JUnit is elegantly simple. It is less complex and takes less time.
	\item JUnit tests can be run automatically and they check their own results and provide immediate feedback. There's no need to manually comb through a report of test results.
	\item JUnit tests can be organized into test suites containing test cases and even other test suites.
	\item JUnit shows test progress in a bar that is green if the test is running smoothly, and it turns red when a test fails.
